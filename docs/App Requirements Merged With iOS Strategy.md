# **Technical Architecture and Strategic Integration Report: The Adaptive Generative Lexical Ecosystem**

## **1\. Executive Summary and Strategic Alignment**

The conceptualization and development of the "Target System" represents a pivotal evolution in Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL), transitioning from static, repository-based applications to a dynamic, autopoietic ecosystem. The strategic integration of the previously defined "Personalized Lexical Ecosystem" with the newly articulated functional requirements for generative content, granular calibration, and rigid morphological structures establishes a sophisticated dual-engine architecture. This architecture synthesizes the mathematical precision of the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS v4.5) with a novel Generative Content Engine (GCE) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synthesis is specifically engineered to address the "Intermediate Plateau"—a critical developmental phase where learners possess a passive receptive vocabulary but lack the retrieval fluency necessary for spontaneous production. By ensuring that all input vectors—ranging from daily notifications to procedurally generated articles—are dynamically calibrated to the user’s "Proximal Zone of Development" based on real-time lexical rank data, the system moves beyond simple gamification into the realm of cognitive augmentation.

The operational success of this system relies on the seamless fusion of three distinct functional domains: Identity and Calibration, Generative Acquisition, and Structural Morphology. The integration of "Sign in with Apple" combined with a granular Initial Lexical Calibration Test addresses the "cold start" problem inherent in algorithmic systems, allowing the retention engine to initialize with high-fidelity user data rather than generic defaults that often lead to user attrition. Furthermore, the introduction of a Daily Word Matrix with a fixed topology of one root and six satellites provides a structured, finite habit loop that complements the infinite variability of the generative article feed. This report provides an exhaustive technical and pedagogical analysis of the requirements necessary to fuse these user stories with the existing offline-first, CRDT-backed iOS architecture, ensuring that every interaction—from the lock screen to the immersive reader—adheres to the principles of Recall Dominance and Contextual Integrity.

The architectural scope extends beyond traditional application boundaries, permeating the user's digital environment through an "Adaptive Push Architecture." This system transforms notifications from passive reminders into primary content delivery channels, serving "Micro-Dose" cards that facilitate immediate pedagogical triage. The requirement for a specific "Don't Add to Deck" mechanism introduces a negative feedback loop essential for refining the recommendation algorithms, ensuring that the user's learning queue remains hygienic and highly relevant. This document serves as the comprehensive blueprint for engineering these systems, detailing the data structures, algorithmic logic, and user experience patterns required to deliver a best-in-class lexical acquisition platform.

## **2\. Functional Requirements: Identity, Privacy, and Initial Calibration**

### **2.1 Authentication Architecture and Privacy Compliance**

To minimize onboarding friction while maximizing user trust and data integrity, the application mandates "Sign in with Apple" as the exclusive or primary authentication method. This requirement aligns with the strategic mandate for a "Personalized Lexical Ecosystem" that respects user privacy while enabling seamless cross-device synchronization. The implementation of this authentication flow is not merely a UI convenience but a foundational security and identity layer that governs how user data is sharded, encrypted, and synced across the distributed CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) architecture.

The system utilizes the ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider framework to request the user's identity. In strict adherence to data minimization principles, the scope of this request is limited to the user's full name and email address during the initial authorization only. A critical component of this requirement is the robust support for Apple's "Hide My Email" private relay service. The backend architecture is engineered to be agnostic to the email format, treating the Apple-generated private relay address (e.g., dpdcnf87nu@privaterelay.apple.com) as the canonical user identifier. This identifier serves as the primary key for database sharding and is mathematically linked to the cryptographic keys used for signing CRDT operations. This ensures that even in the event of a central server compromise, the user's learning history—comprising sensitive performance data and retention intervals—remains cryptographically verifiable and private.1

Upon successful authentication, the system must securely store the user credential state in the iOS Keychain. This local persistence is vital for the offline-first capability of the application, allowing the user to access the application and perform reviews without an active network connection immediately after the first launch. The design dictates that the ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential is exchanged for a session token that authenticates the device against the CloudKit container or custom WebSocket sync server. This "One-Tap" entry point significantly reduces the drop-off rates associated with traditional email/password registration flows, directly supporting the strategic goal of reducing friction to near-zero. Furthermore, this integration supports the "Personalized Lexical Ecosystem" vision by allowing the user to move seamlessly between iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with their lexical state preserving continuity across all surfaces.3

### **2.2 The Lexical Calibration Engine (LCE)**

The user requirements explicitly call for a test that is "more detailed than CEFR level," necessitating a paradigm shift from broad proficiency bands to a high-resolution rank-based assessment. Traditional CEFR placements (A1 through C2) provide insufficient granularity for a sophisticated algorithmic scheduler like FSRS. A user classified as "B2" might possess a vocabulary ranging anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 word families. This variance is too high for the initialization of stability parameters. Therefore, the system requires the calculation of a scalar value—the Lexical Rank (![][image1])—representing the user's precise estimated vocabulary size (e.g., 4,350 words).

#### **2.2.1 Item Response Theory and Adaptive Testing Methodology**

The Initial Lexical Calibration Test is engineered as a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) utilizing Item Response Theory (IRT). Unlike linear tests that present a fixed set of questions, this adaptive engine dynamically selects items based on the user's previous responses to maximize information gain and minimize test duration. The test draws from a stratified database of words derived from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) or the British National Corpus (BNC), segmented into 1,000-word frequency bands extending up to the 20,000th rank.5

The testing interface avoids simple multiple-choice questions, which are prone to guessing inflation—a phenomenon where users can statistically guess correctly 25% of the time, leading to drastic overestimations of vocabulary size. Instead, the system implements a "Yes/No" checklist format with non-word lures (pseudowords) to detect overclaiming, or a forced-choice synonym matching task where the distractors are carefully calibrated to be of higher frequency than the target word. This ensures that a failure to answer correctly is due to ignorance of the target word, not the distractors. The algorithm employs a binary search strategy across the frequency bands. It might begin by presenting items from the 2,000–3,000 rank band. If the user demonstrates mastery, the engine jumps to the 5,000 band; if they fail, it descends to the 1,000 band. This pivots continues until the system converges on a specific rank with a confidence interval of ![][image2] words.8

#### **2.2.2 Mapping Lexical Rank to Algorithmic Initialization**

The critical innovation in this architecture is the direct mapping of the static test result (![][image1]) to the dynamic variables of the FSRS algorithm. In a standard FSRS implementation, all new cards begin with a Stability (![][image3]) of 0\. However, for a user with an established ![][image1] of 5,000, treating high-frequency words like "Apple" (Rank 50\) and "Cacophony" (Rank 4,999) identically is inefficient and leads to user boredom ("Ease Hell").

To resolve this, the system performs a "Warm Start" initialization of the user's VocabularyDB. Words with a frequency rank significantly lower than the user's ![][image1] (e.g., Rank \< ![][image4]) are implicitly marked as "Known" (Passive). These items are not added to the active review queue but are available for morphological analysis. Crucially, the system injects a "Virtual Review History" for these items, setting their initial Stability (![][image3]) to a high value (e.g., 365 days). This effectively tells the FSRS algorithm that the user has successfully recalled these words multiple times in the past, pushing their next review far into the future. Words located within the "Proximal Zone of Development"—defined as the range ![][image5]—are flagged as "High Priority Candidates." For these items, the initial Stability is set to near-zero, treating them as true learning targets that require immediate and frequent repetition.10 This calibration ensures that the user's first engagement with the app is challenging yet manageable, directly addressing the "Intermediate Plateau."

## **3\. The Generative Acquisition Engine (GCE) and Interest Modeling**

### **3.1 Dynamic Content Generation via LLM Integration**

The requirement for articles to be "created for user via LLM API" based on "users interests" necessitates a sophisticated Generative Content Engine (GCE) that bridges the gap between user preferences and their lexical constraints. This module acts as an intelligent intermediary between the user's profile and external Large Language Model APIs (such as OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's Gemini). The goal is to produce infinite, personalized reading material that adheres to the "i+1" input hypothesis, where the content is just slightly above the user's current level.

#### **3.1.1 Interest Vector Modeling and Data Structures**

To facilitate personalized generation, the application includes a granular "Interest Selector" during the onboarding phase, which remains accessible via the Profile settings. Unlike generic categories, this selector supports specific niches (e.g., "Molecular Gastronomy," "19th Century Maritime History," "DeFi Cryptocurrency"). These interests are stored as an InterestVector within the user's profile data structure. This vector includes a "Strength" weight that dynamically adjusts based on user engagement; reading an article about "Space" increases the weight of that node, while ignoring "Cooking" articles decreases it. This data model is synced across devices using the CRDT layer, ensuring that the user's content feed evolves consistently whether they are on their iPhone or iPad.

#### **3.1.2 Rank-Constrained Prompt Engineering**

The core of the GCE is the construction of the system prompt sent to the LLM. Standard prompts asking for "intermediate English" often yield inconsistent results. Therefore, the system utilizes "Rank-Constrained Prompt Engineering." The prompt template is dynamically assembled using the user's ![][image1] and selected interest.

A representative prompt structure would be:

"Act as an expert ESL content generator. Write a 400-word article about. **Constraint:** Ensure that 95% of the vocabulary is drawn from the top most frequent English words. **Target:** Deliberately include 5-7 'Target Words' drawn from the frequency band to. Output the response in JSON format containing fields for 'title', 'body\_text', and 'target\_vocabulary\_indices'. Do not use academic jargon above rank 15,000 without immediate parenthetical definition.".12

This strict prompting strategy enforces the pedagogical requirement that content remains accessible while introducing a controlled number of "challenge words." The JSON output format allows the client-side application to parse the text and apply specific UI treatments (such as highlighting) to the target words without complex regex parsing on the device.

### **3.2 Client-Side Proximal Filtering and Triage**

The user requirement specifies that "in article, words only near to user rank should can be selected and add to deck." This dictates that the application cannot blindly trust the LLM's output. The "Immersive Reader" component must implement a client-side "Proximal Filter" that validates the frequency rank of every interactive token in real-time.

When the article is rendered, the TextKit 2 engine tokenizes the content and cross-references each lemma against the local SQLite Frequency Database (containing the COCA/BNC lists). The highlighting logic applies a "Traffic Light" system based on the user's ![][image1]:

* **Blue (New/Target):** Words with a rank in the range ![][image6]. These are the optimal candidates for acquisition. Tapping these words triggers the "Add to Deck" card.  
* **Red/Dimmed (Too Hard):** Words with a rank ![][image7]. The system may suppress the "Add to Deck" prompt for these words or display a "Rare Word Warning," advising the user that learning this word is inefficient at their current stage.  
* **Unmarked (Known):** Words with a rank ![][image8]. These are assumed to be known and do not distract the user.

This filtering logic ensures that the "Add to Deck" action is reserved for high-value vocabulary, preventing the user's review queue from becoming cluttered with obscure terms (e.g., "defenestrate") before they have mastered essential intermediate vocabulary (e.g., "maintain").

## **4\. The Structural Morphology Matrix and Daily Habit Loops**

### **4.1 The Static Daily Rotation Architecture**

The requirement for a "word matrix is static daily change" introduces a finite, shared habit loop into the application. Unlike the personalized FSRS queue, the Matrix provides a communal anchor—a "Wordle-like" daily experience where all users engage with the same root concept. This is technically implemented using a deterministic hashing algorithm. The "Daily Root" is selected by hashing the current Epoch Day against the size of the root database (e.g., DayID % 1000). This ensures that the daily content is consistent across all devices and requires no server-side coordination, functioning perfectly offline.

The system is provisioned with a local database of 1,000 high-frequency morphological roots (e.g., *SPECT*, *DUCT*, *FER*, *GRAPH*). The requirement to "add after 1000 days" implies an extensible content architecture. The app utilizes a "DLC" (Downloadable Content) or "Season" model. Upon the completion of the first 1,000-day cycle (approx. 2.7 years), the system unlocks the next tier of roots (Roots 1001–2000). This logic is managed via a CycleCount variable in the user's profile, ensuring the app remains viable for long-term usage without content repetition.15

### **4.2 The "6-Satellite" Topology and Graph Visualization**

The user specifies a rigid topology: "there will be 6 word connected to root in every matrix." This constraint requires careful curation of the linguistic database. The visualization utilizes a Force-Directed Graph layout, powered by SwiftUI Layouts or a library like Grape. The central node represents the Daily Root (e.g., *PORT*), pulsating to indicate its centrality. Radiating from this hub are six "Satellite Nodes," representing derived words (e.g., *Import*, *Export*, *Transport*, *Deport*, *Important*, *Portal*).

The selection of these six satellites is not static but algorithmically curated based on the user's ![][image1]. For a beginner (![][image9]), the satellites might be high-frequency derivatives like *Report* or *Support*. For an advanced user (![][image10]), the system dynamically swaps these for lower-frequency, abstract derivatives such as *Deportment* or *Portage*. This "Dynamic Population" of the static matrix structure ensures that the daily feature remains pedagogically relevant regardless of the user's proficiency. If a root has fewer than six direct high-frequency derivatives, the system fills the empty slots with second-degree connections (e.g., synonyms or antonyms), visually distinguished by dashed link lines to preserve morphological clarity.16

## **5\. Intelligent Engagement and The Adaptive Notification Architecture**

### **5.1 Push-Based Micro-Learning**

The user requires that the app "should recommend words via notifications" and that tapping them opens a card. This moves the notification system from a metadata channel (reminders) to a content channel. The system utilizes the "Bandit Algorithm" (a reinforcement learning model) to determine the optimal timing for these notifications, but the payload is now strictly constrained to the "High Priority Candidates" identified by the Calibration Engine.

To mitigate "Notification Fatigue," the system leverages the Core Motion framework to calculate "Interruptibility." Notifications are triggered not at arbitrary times but during state transitions—specifically, the transition from "Active" (Walking/Driving) to "Stationary." This correlates with moments of availability, such as sitting down on a bus or arriving home. The payload includes the target word, a phonetic guide, and a cloze sentence context, delivered via iOS Rich Notifications.17

### **5.2 Actionable Notification Logic**

The requirement that "user can add words via notifications" necessitates the use of iOS UNNotificationAction categories. This allows the user to interact with the content directly from the Lock Screen or Notification Center without fully launching the app. The notification provides three distinct actions:

1. **"Reveal":** Updates the notification interface locally to show the definition and synonyms, utilizing the iOS 12+ dynamic notification extension capabilities.  
2. **"Add to Deck":** Triggers a background intent that injects the word into the FSRS review queue with an initial stability (![][image3]) of 0\.  
3. **"Ignore":** Adds the word to a Blacklist Bloom Filter, preventing it from being recommended again.

Tapping the body of the notification performs a "Deep Link" directly to a specific "Single Card View" within the app. This view bypasses the standard dashboard and presents the word card in "Prompt Mode" (answer hidden), adhering to the "Recall Dominance" design principle.

### **5.3 In-App Card Triage: The Info and "Don't Add" Buttons**

Once a card is revealed—whether via notification tap or article selection—the user requirements mandate specific UI elements for triage. The Card Detail View includes an "Info Button" (![][image11]) which, when tapped, toggles a metadata overlay containing the dictionary definition, synonyms, and an interactive audio button for neural text-to-speech pronunciation.

Crucially, the interface includes a prominent "Don't Add to My Deck" button. This button is critical for data hygiene. When tapped, it transitions the word's state to Ignored and updates the user's Blacklist. This interaction also serves as a negative reward signal for the recommendation algorithm. If a user consistently rejects words from a specific frequency band (e.g., rejecting Rank 8,000 words), the system infers that the estimated ![][image1] may be too high or the interest modeling is inaccurate, triggering a downward adjustment in the target rank for future recommendations. Ergonomically, this button is placed in the "Thumb Zone" (bottom left) to ensure it is easily accessible during one-handed use.18

## **6\. Adaptive Progression and The FSRS Feedback Loop**

### **6.1 The "Easy" Rating Feedback Mechanism**

The user specifies a sophisticated feedback loop: "while user learn words, clicking easy, notifications should send higher rank words and articles should generated w higher rank words." This establishes a direct link between the micro-interactions of the retention engine and the macro-parameters of the acquisition engine.

The system implements a "Rank Floor Elevation" algorithm. It maintains a moving average of the user's FSRS ratings over a rolling window (e.g., the last 50 reviews). If the percentage of "Easy" (4) ratings exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., \> 60%) while the Retention Rate (![][image12]) remains above 90%, the system triggers a "Rank Promotion Event." This event increments the user's ![][image1] by a fixed step (e.g., \+200 words).

### **6.2 Mathematical Impact on Content Generation**

This elevation of ![][image1] immediately propagates to the other modules:

* **Notification Engine:** The "High Priority Candidate" band shifts upwards (e.g., from 3,000–3,500 to 3,200–3,700), ensuring that new recommendations are slightly more challenging.  
* **Generative Content Engine:** The prompt template for the LLM is updated. The variable \`\` in the prompt "Ensure 90% of vocabulary is from top" increases, instructing the AI to utilize a more sophisticated lexicon.

This dynamic adjustment creates a "Desirable Difficulty" loop. As the user masters content (signaled by "Easy" ratings), the system automatically ramps up the complexity of the input, preventing stagnation. Conversely, if "Hard" or "Again" ratings dominate, the ![][image1] stabilizes or decreases, reducing the complexity of incoming articles and notifications to prevent cognitive overload.19

## **7\. Data Structures and Synchronization Tables**

The implementation of this ecosystem requires specific data models to handle the state, rank, and generated content. The following tables outline the core schema attributes required for SwiftData persistence and CRDT synchronization.

### **Table 1: Extended User Profile Schema**

| Field Name | Type | Description | Sync Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| lexicalRank | Int | Current estimated vocabulary size (e.g., 4500). Updated by Calibration and "Easy" loop. | LWW-Register (Last Write Wins) |
| interestVector | \`\` | Map of interests and their weight (e.g., "Space": 0.8). | OR-Map (Observed Remove Map) |
| ignoredWords | BloomFilter | Probabilistic structure for rejected words. Efficient space usage. | G-Set (Grow-only Set) |
| easyRatingVelocity | Double | Moving average of "Easy" grades over last 50 reviews. | LWW-Register |

### **Table 2: Generated Article Schema**

| Field Name | Type | Description | Sync Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| articleID | UUID | Unique identifier for the generated content. | Immutable Key |
| contentBody | String | The raw text generated by the LLM. | Cached Locally (Ephemeral) |
| targetRank | Int | The ![][image1] used to generate this specific article. | Metadata Only |
| targetWords | \`\` | References to the specific VocabularyItems highlighted. | Relationship |
| isSaved | Bool | Flag indicating if user saved article to permanent library. | LWW-Register |

The GeneratedArticle entity is treated as ephemeral by default to save storage and bandwidth. It is cached locally on the device but is only synchronized to the cloud (and thus other devices) if the user explicitly marks it as isSaved. This hybrid sync strategy balances the "Personalized Ecosystem" requirement with data efficiency.

## **8\. Conclusion**

The architecture defined in this report represents a comprehensive response to the user's requirements, merging them with high-fidelity iOS development standards and cognitive science principles. By replacing the static, linear progression of traditional apps with an **Adaptive Generative Lexical Ecosystem**, the "Target System" offers a solution that evolves in lockstep with the learner.

The integration of **Sign in with Apple** and **IRT Calibration** establishes a precise and private user baseline. The **Generative Content Engine** leverages the power of LLMs to provide infinite, interest-aligned reading material that respects the user's lexical boundaries. The **Daily Word Matrix** offers a structured, communal habit loop anchored in morphological science. Finally, the **FSRS Feedback Loop** ensures that the system is self-correcting; the user's subjective experience of difficulty directly modulates the objective complexity of the content they receive. This closed-loop system fulfills the strategic vision of solving the "Intermediate Plateau," providing a tool that is not merely an application, but a responsive cognitive companion.
