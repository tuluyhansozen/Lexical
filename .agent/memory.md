# Lexical Project Memory

## Architectural Decisions
- **Agent-First Architecture**: Shift from manual coding to orchestration within Antigravity IDE.
- **Offline-First**: Use SwiftData and CRDTs for data consistency across devices.
- **FSRS v4.5**: Core retention algorithm used for spaced repetition.
- **Liquid Glass UI**: Modern, glassmorphic design system for iOS.
- **Pre-seeded Vocabulary**: Seed pipeline in place; starter seed included (expand to 500–1000 words).

## Core Components
- **FSRS Engine**: Spaced repetition scheduling.
- **Immersive Reader**: TextKit 2 based reading experience with "Tap-to-Capture".
- **CRDT Sync**: Decentralized synchronization logic.
- **NLP Pipeline**: `TokenizationActor` + `LemmaResolver` for lemmatization.
- **Review Engine**: `SessionManager` + `FlashcardView` with Brain Boost re-queueing.
- **Bandit Scheduler**: Epsilon-Greedy MAB for notification timing optimization.
- **Collocation Matrix**: Force-directed graph visualization of semantic connections.
- **Vocabulary Seeding**: `VocabularySeedService` + `vocab_seed.json` first-launch seeding.
- **Onboarding Coordinator**: First-run phase flow (welcome, FSRS primer, interests, reading primer, notification opt-in, completion) with resumable progress.
- **E2E Harness**: `scripts/e2e/run.sh` black-box simulator flow plus `scripts/ui_automation/run_true_ui.sh` true UI automation (`idb` taps + accessibility assertions) for onboarding, free/premium reading states, and prompt-route behavior.
- **Debug Verification**: Seed count overlay (DEBUG) + `--lexical-debug-autocycle` tab cycling for simulator checks.

## SwiftData Models
- `VocabularyItem`: Core model with FSRS fields and `collocations` (Many-to-Many self-reference)
- `ReviewLog`: Immutable append-only for CRDT sync

## Current Placeholder Status
- **Explore Tab (Tab 1)**: ✅ `ExploreView.swift` (Matrix + Search)
- **Stats Tab (Tab 3)**: ✅ `StatsView.swift` + `StatsService` real period snapshots
- **Profile (Tab 4)**: ✅ `SettingsView.swift`

## Completion Phases (8-10)
- **Phase 8**: ✅ Navigation, seeding, personalization, and rank-aware targeting completed.
- **Phase 9**: ✅ Identity, calibration, dual-store migration, and sync foundation completed.
- **Phase 10**: ✅ Completed: adaptive prompting/generated-content lifecycle, daily root resolver extraction, and notification triage service integration verified by simulator test + smoke run.
- **Phase 11**: 🟡 In progress: onboarding v1 integrated at app root; notification permission is now contextual (not launch-time); true UI automation harness added for 5 core user flows.

## Environment Notes
- **MCP Servers**: `ios-simulator`, `filesystem`, `context7` for agentic interactions.
- **uv Integration**: Python script execution via uv for zero-setup utility tasks.
- **Simulator**: iPhone 16e (98FACCED-3F83-4A94-8D7B-F8905AAF08D1)
