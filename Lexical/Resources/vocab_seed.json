Every person eventually realizes that time is the most valuable resource on the planet. Not oil or uranium. Not lithium or anything else, but time. Time. The very flow of time convinces us of this. Some people realize this sooner, and these are the lucky ones. Others realize it too late when they lose someone or something. People cannot avoid it, this is just a matter of time. But there is a fundamental difference that comes down to the question of time. The time of your life is under your control. The time of life of our force on the front line, the time of life of all Ukrainians who are forced to live through this terrible Russian aggression unfortunately is subject to many factors that are not all in their control. I do not wish anyone to feel like they are in my shoes, and it's impossible to give a manual on how to go through life so as not to waste time. However, one piece of advice always works. You have to know exactly why you need today and how you want your tomorrows to look like.",

It is interesting that up to the 1950s a \"quantity\" was defined as what we now describe as \"magnitude\" (e.g., the unabridged Webster's New International Dictionary, 1948, gives examples of a sphere's surface being a quantity, its area a magnitude, or a yardstick being a quantity, its length a magnitude). This practice is now obsolete and at present length is a quantity, its numerical value its magnitude.",

But it is more than a regurgitation of the many formulas you may recall learning in high school. In the book, Dr. Cheng argues that an equation — in its barest sense, a declaration that two things are equal — can be a profound statement on the choices we make about what is or is not the same. For example, 2 × 3 may equal 3 × 2. But two packs of three cookies each is distinct from three packs of two cookies each. A cube drawn face-on versus from one edge looks different, though we understand the two shapes to be the same. \"Almost everything can be considered equal and unequal at the same time,\" Dr. Cheng wrote. \"And it's up to us what we do about it.\"",

In contrast this external reality check appears to be present in the high-functioning autistic mind. It is thought that the autistic mind is more intimately connected with objective reality via its external sensory focus on reality and its superior understanding of physical causality, relative to neurotypical persons (Baron-Cohen et al. 1999; Paganini and Gaido 2013) and is therefore less susceptible to supernatural experiences or explanations.",

Calamitous as were the many eruptions of nature by which this island [Barbados] had suffered, the aggregate destruction produced by them was probably unequal to that effected by the storm of August 1831. That of 1675, according to the description given in history, very much resembled it in appearance, duration, and fury; but the extent to which human life was sacrificed is not on record. Although many persons then perished, it is reasonable to suppose that the numbers bore no proportion to those whose loss this mourning island now deplores. The hurricane of 1780, fearfully tremendous as it was, is admitted by all living witnesses to have been far much inferior in force, and less destructive to the country ; but its protracted continuance served to effect the damage then occasioned. […] Captain Charles Cooper, of the mail-boat schooner Friends, on his arrival from Trinidad, Grenada, and St. Vincent's, reported, that on the 23rd of June he had experienced a tremendous gale five leagues to the southward of Grenada. It continued without intermission for five hours, during the whole of which time the vessel was hove nearly on her beam ends. Captain J.MᶜGregor, of His Majesty's 1st or Royal Regiment, and other passengers were on board, and every one, as well as the master and crew, expected to have been entombed by the foaming ocean. At Grenada the gale was described as more severe than any that had been experienced since the hurricane of 1780. At an early hour in the morning \"the sea became considerably agitated, and sent forth a noise, which, contrasted with the stillness of the atmosphere, inspired a strange and unaccountable feeling.\" The morning dawned with a heavy and perturbed sky, but it was not until near noon that the hurricane commenced. Between 3 and 4 in the afternoon the tempest had attained its height, after which it gradually moderated. The damage inflicted on the country was severely felt, but with one exception there was no loss of life.",

The usual indications of a storm in connexion with these instruments are the falling of the barometer and the freshening of the wind, and it is generally considered that a rapid fall of the mercury in the hurricane regions invariably precedes the setting in of a storm. There are three classes of phænomena that present themselves to an observer, according as he is situated on the line or axis of translation, or in either the right or left hand semicircle of the storm. These will be rendered very apparent by a little attention to the annexed engraving, fig. 1. In this figure the arrow-head is supposed to be directed true north, and the hurricane—as is the case in the American storms north of the 30th parallel—to be moving towards the N.E. on the line N.E.–S.W. If the ship take the hurricane with the wind S.E.,— the letters within the two larger circles indicating the direction of the wind in the storm according to the rotation as shown by the circle of arrow-heads […]",

In a province with a long and dangerous maritime history, the Baltic's grounding in the roiling shallows of Cedar Cove last February is a story Newfoundlanders retell with incredulity. The cargo ship, en route to Corner Brook from Montreal, lost power in the early morning of Feb. 15 during a ferocious blizzard. The ship, packed with hundreds of containers of lumber, textiles, plastic beads, legumes and car parts, plus 1,600 metric tonnes of fuel, careered into the only safe harbour along a coast of towering cliffs. All 20 crew members were airlifted off the ship in a harrowing rescue by the Royal Canadian Air Force. Over the following months, salvage crews offloaded most of the 470 containers and siphoned out the fuel, which had hardened into an asphalt-like substance, in a multistage operation that involved heating it for days. At risk were local wildlife — migratory birds and the capelin and lobster that local fish harvesters rely on for their livelihoods. The goal of the work is to ready the ship for eventual dismantling and removal from the shoreline.",
